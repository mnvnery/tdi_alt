synopsis: "<p>Setting-out from the meteorological diaries of the American artist Henry
  Darger, CYCLONE investigates the ascendancy of the meteorological conditions on
  the human condition: the desire to transform, to create order in chaos, to seek
  new realities. It stems from an objective observation of atmospheric weather and
  the binary forecast/event. The cycle of expectation / disillusionment associated
  with weather forecast is transposed, in accordance with the same principle of dichotomy,
  to human beings, given that the body is the privileged place for this research:
  place of destruction and reconstruction.</p>"
