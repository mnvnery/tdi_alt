synopsis: '<p>Following a process of putting together and presenting a show, an actress
  is strangely affected by that work which has now ended. Her body is in conflict:
  is it as if something was born within it - a figure, a spirit? It is not known what
  it is. She admits the possibility that your body is under the influence of something
  (energies, spirits?), something that seems to want to take hold of itself or to
  inhabit in her.</p><p>Meanwhile, the theater company begins the process of making
  a new show, “Cassandra”, but the injuries (physical, psychological - all the same)
  of the last work remain in the body of the actress, compromising her well-being
  and availability to the new production. Starting from this conflict, a dialogue
  is established concerning questions related to illusion, belief, spiritism, theater,
  etc. One follows the journey of this woman, in her attempt of resolution or search
  for an answer to that mysterious phenomenon to which her body is now subject."</p>'
