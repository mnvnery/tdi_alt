synopsis: '<p>“To Have Done With the Judgment of god” is the name of Antonin Artaud’s
  last work. This radio play is censored on the eve of its intended broadcast, on
  February 8, 1948. Artaud dies a month later, leaving behind a legacy of letters
  that express how much he had felt betrayed and misunderstood all through his life.
  Seventy-four years later, the <em>poète maudit </em>found justice, and his unruly
  genius soars over those who want to make<strong>, </strong>and like him transcend<strong>,
  </strong>theatre.</p><p>With this performance, that consists in a radio broadcast
  and a sensorial experiment for the audience, we want toacknowledge Artaud: love
  the poet and rebel against him with the same artistic gesture: recreate “To Have
  Done With the Judgment of god” and at the same time, rethink our concept of genius
  and of masterpieces. As he wrote himself: "The masterpieces of the past are good
  for the past, not for us. We have the right to say what has been said and even what
  has not been said in a way that is ours, immediate, direct, that responds to current
  ways of feeling and that the whole world understands."</p>'
