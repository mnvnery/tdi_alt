synopsis: "<p>August 5, 2062. Interior, late afternoon. A family brings together a
  film crew: everything is ready to document the last fifty years of their lives,
  which have undoubtedly gone through the signs of the times. Bitter, like lemons,
  and sometimes sweet when spring bursts with its seasonal fruit. In the present day,
  the four stations have become a single one. The climate is adverse, but everything
  is ready to document, redo and reorganize a story that encloses / encompasses so
  many lies, so many truths. Who can we trust? Who can we distrust, when History is
  told? To whom can we entrust History? So many people have already been lost, haven’t
  they? If they were here, we couldn’t tell this story, we couldn’t count on History.</p>"

  bio: "<p><strong>SillySeason </strong>is an artists collective (Cátia Tomá, Ivo
    Saraiva and Ricardo Teixeira) that, since 2012, have been reflecting about theatre
    and the performing arts, in a constant search for new models of creation. They
    have contributed to the production and advancement of new dramaturgies, in an
    ongoing consideration of what is theater, or what it may become. They promote
    the construction of objects that challenge their own usual logics, as well as
    creating a framework to speculate about multifaceted works.</p><p>Their work is
    based above all around the notion of crises, debunking<strong> </strong>it while
    suggesting new dimensions of social, political and historical nature with the
    intent of consolidating an increasingly urgent discourse about a future. <strong>SillySeason</strong>
    have sought to establish collaborative practices and networking, interacting with
    several artists from different areas and with several structures and institutions.</p><p>The
    SillySeason Collective is a structure funded by the Direção Geral das Artes -
    República Portuguesa.</p><p><br></p>"
