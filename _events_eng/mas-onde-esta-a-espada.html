synopsis: "<p>The stone that generates the first blade is tripartite. It hasn’t been
  decisive to the knowledge of the interior, nor has it preceded the hunt or the will
  to hurt. However, inevitably, new stories of the body have been molded by the sword.</p><p>The
  interior, the exterior, the internalized exterior, the interior exteriorized - impossible
  to escape from it - the inside and the outside, border, delimitation, differentiation,
  imagination, exteriorization of an exterior interiority interiorization of exteriority
  Xter- what does it matter? Multiple though one, thus is the admiration for X, Y
  and Z. “Mas Onde Está a Espada?” is a site-specific work that examines the phenomenon
  a chant, the architectural miracle, following the tradition of the Corner Pieces,
  such as those of Joseph Beuys or Bruce Nauman. This piece is built up and disappears
  around concepts such as the landscape and the forming of three-dimensionality, nature
  and creation, the abstract and the figurative.</p>"
